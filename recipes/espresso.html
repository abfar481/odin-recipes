        <p>First, we're going through process of making espresso with proper Espresso Machine, don't worry, I'll cover
            up the process with manual espresso maker later on.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Weight your coffee beans, starts from 16gr up to 22gr of coffee beans, depending on your basket sizes
            </li>
            <li>Set your grinder adjustment to fine adjustment (Tips: set your grinder not to the finest adjustment, but
                a couple steps away from the finest)</li>
            <li>Put your coffee beans to the grinder, and also your portafilter into the grinder spout, and start
                grinding</li>
            <li>Once you finish grinding your coffee beans to the portafilter, start distribude your coffee ground
                evenly through out your basket</li>
            <li>After finish distribude your coffee ground evenly, tamp it, it dosen't matter how force you put, what
                matter is tamp it evenly flat</li>
            <li>Put your portafilter into the espresso machine</li>
            <li>Put your scale underneath it to track your yield</li>
            <li>Put your cup to catch the yield</li>
            <li>Zero your scale, and start brewing by pressing brew button in your espresso machine while simultaniously
                pressing the timer to track your brewing time, try to aiming 1:2 - 1:2.5 ratios, meaning 1 part of
                coffee ground to 2 part of water(18gr of coffee to 36gr of yield)</li>
            <li>After you nailed your brew ratios, see how much time it take to brew your coffee, if it too fast like
                below 20 seconds, adjust
                your grinder finner. If it slow like more than 30 seconds, adjust your grinder coarser</li>

            usually manual espresso maker use less coffee than espresso machine does, typicly around 12gr to 16gr of
            coffee ground</p>
        <p>The best practice is to weight your your coffee ground while you put it into the basket</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Once you've done doing the "Puck Prep", put everything back together to start the brewing process</li>
            <li>Turn on your kettle until your water starts boiling</li>
            <li>Pour the boiling water into the specific chamber for hot water in your manual espresso maker</li>
            <li>And same as the brewing process above, put your scale underneath it and your cup to catch the yield</li>
            <li>Start your timer, and start the brewing process by pressing down the mekanism in your espresso maker
            </li>
            <li>The ratios 1:2 - 1:2.5 are still the same as above</li>

        <h4>How to Tweek Your Espresso</h4>
        <p>My best advice is always track your dose, time, and yield. So you have much more information and you can
            repeat making good espresso once you find a perfect recipes that suit you</p>
        <p>Try to adjust your grinder finner if you brew your espresso too fast with the ratios. If its too slow, try to
            adjust your grinder coarser. Try to take time on "Puck Prep" to make it as even as possible will also help
            your extraction.</p>

            good fresh espresso that you can repeat and explore another espresso base recipes in the next recipes

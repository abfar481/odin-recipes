    <h3>Americano</h3>
    <p>Americano is also one of the OG coffee drinks that use espresso as the main ingridients. By adding water on your
        espresso, without losing its complexity and sweetnes of your espresso, but you can enjoy it for longer period of
        time, the drawback is only you might lose some texture of your espresso</p>
    <p>During World War II, American soldiers stationed in Italy felt the traditional Italian espresso was too strong
        for their taste and opted for a watered-down version. They wanted a drink that tasted similar to the drip coffee
        they had back in America, thus, the Americano. And here we are now.</p>

        <h4>How to make your Americano</h4>
        <p>A simple and easy recipe to step up your coffee expreince, and you can even customize and experiment your
            coffee to make your own version of it, in this case, Americano.</p>
        <p>How to make American step by step:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour your espresso into a bigger glass, I suggest to start in double shot of espresso, which is around
                32-50gr of espresso, depending on your brew ratios</li>
            <li>Add some water to your espresso, I suggest to pour around 100-130gr of water if you prefer ice americano
                and added some ice into, and 130-150gr of water if you prefer hot americano. You can add more or less
                water to your like, to get stronger result by reducing the water, and to get weaker result by increasing
                the water</li>
            <li>To make your own version, and you need some flavor, just add some syrup of your choice</li>
            <li>You can even customize it to make your own uniqly americano, maybe by adding some topping, such as
                adding some whip cream on top of it, or adding some jelly, or maybe adding some "boba".</li>
            <li>And now just enjoy it. There is no standard way to enjoy and customize americano, the limit is only your
                own creativity.</li>
        </ol>
